# Distributed File System Requirements

## System Overview
The distributed file system (DFS) will consist of three main components: the Master Server, Chunk Servers, and Clients. The DFS will provide fault tolerance, high availability, and efficient data access.

## Functional Requirements

### Master Server
- **Metadata Management**
  - Store and manage metadata for files and directories.
  - Track chunk locations and maintain chunk mappings.
- **Chunk Assignment**
  - Assign chunks to chunk servers during file creation.
  - Manage and update chunk replicas.
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**
  - Monitor the status of chunk servers through regular heartbeats.
  - Detect failures and trigger re-replication.
- **Failure Detection and Recovery**
  - Detect chunk server failures.
  - Reassign chunks and ensure data replication for failed chunk servers.

### Chunk Servers
- **Chunk Storage**
  - Store data chunks on local disk.
  - Provide read and write access to data chunks.
- **Replication**
  - Store multiple replicas of each chunk.
  - Handle replication requests from the master server.
- **Heartbeat Communication**
  - Send regular heartbeat messages to the master server.

### Clients
- **File Operations**
  - Read and write files through interaction with chunk servers.
  - Communicate with the master server to obtain chunk locations.
- **Caching**
  - Cache frequently accessed metadata to reduce load on the master server.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Low-latency access to data chunks.
- Efficient metadata operations.

### Scalability
- Support for a large number of files and directories.
- Efficient scaling with the addition of chunk servers.

### Reliability
- Fault tolerance through data replication.
- Consistent and reliable metadata management.

### Security
- Access control for files and directories.
- Secure communication between components.

## Use Cases

### File Creation
- Client requests the master server to create a new file.
- Master server assigns chunks to chunk servers.
- Client writes data to the assigned chunk servers.

### File Reading
- Client requests chunk locations from the master server.
- Client reads data directly from chunk servers.

### File Writing
- Client requests chunk locations from the master server.
- Client writes data to chunk servers, ensuring consistency and replication.

### Chunk Server Failure
- Master server detects a failed chunk server through missed heartbeats.
- Master server triggers re-replication of lost chunks to other chunk servers.

## Dependencies
- **Go**: Programming language for implementing the DFS.
- **gRPC**: Framework for remote procedure calls between components.
- **Protocol Buffers**: Serialization format for gRPC messages.
- **Raft/Paxos**: Consensus algorithm for leader election in the master server.
- **Persistent Storage**: Local file system or database for storing metadata.
